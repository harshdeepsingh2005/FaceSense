# 😃 FaceSense - Facial Emotion Detection AI

FaceSense is a real-time facial emotion detection web app powered by deep learning. It uses a Keras-trained model to classify emotions from webcam or uploaded images and visualizes results with interactive analytics and scenario-based advice.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📸 Real-time webcam-based emotion detection  
- 🖼️ Upload image for emotion prediction  
- 📈 Live analytics dashboard for past detection logs  
- 🧠 AI-generated advice based on emotional trends  
- 🧪 Scenario-based emotion simulation (e.g., Interview, Exam)  
- 🌗 Dark mode toggle, confidence bar, emoji feedback  
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS responsive UI with smooth transitions
